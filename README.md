## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size

- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - For styles

### What I learned

I have made practices about TypeScript, SCSS and ContextAPI.

### Continued development

I would like to learn Next.js and try to code new project with it.

### Useful resources

- [ReactJS Documents](https://reactjs.org/) - This documents helped me to create Contexts.
- [SCSS Documents](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This is an amazing article which helped me SCSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
